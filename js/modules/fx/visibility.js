// Chorus â†’ Tone.StereoXFeedbackEffect
// Tone.Chorus is a stereo chorus effect with feedback composed of a left and right delay with a Tone.LFO applied to the delayTime of each channel. Inspiration from Tuna.js. Read more on the chorus effect on SoundOnSound.
// new Tone.Chorus ([frequency][, delayTime][, depth]) 
//  .frequency ~ {Frequency} : The frequency of the LFO which modulates the delayTime.
// .depth {NormalRange} :  The depth of the effect. A depth of 1 makes the delayTime modulate between 0 and 2*delayTime (centered around the delayTime).
// .delayTime {Number} : The delayTime in milliseconds of the chorus. A larger delayTime will give a more pronounced effect. Nominal range a delayTime is between 2 and 20ms.
